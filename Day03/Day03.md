## Tasks Completed

### Task 01: Complete the CRUD Project

- Built a Spring Boot application for basic Book Management.
- Implemented **CRUD operations**:
  - **Create** (`POST /api/v1/book`)
  - **Read** (`GET /api/v1/book/{id}` and `GET /api/v1/book`)
  - **Update** (`PUT /api/v1/book/{id}`)
  - **Delete** (`DELETE /api/v1/book/{id}`)
- Used standard Spring Boot layers:
  - `Controller`
  - `Service`
  - `Repository`
  - `DTO`, `Entity`, and `Mapper`

> Note: Some CRUD-related topics are not fully covered and a few minor errors still exist. However, the **project runs** and **all main APIs are working** as expected.

### Task 02: Hands-On Introduction to Spring Boot

####  Topics Covered by Me:

| Topic              | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **ORM**            | Explained Object Relational Mapping and how it's used to map classes to database tables. |
| **Hibernate**      | Introduced Hibernate as the JPA provider used for ORM. |
| **Bean**           | Covered the concept of Spring Beans and their lifecycle. |
| **POJO**           | Discussed POJOs and their role in modeling data. |
| **IoC (Inversion of Control)** | Explained how Spring manages object creation and injection. |
| **@RestController** | Demonstrated how to expose RESTful endpoints using this annotation. |

##  Additional Notes

-  **Today I understood the basic project structure** and how different layers interact in a Spring Boot application.
-  **All topics are not fully clear yet**, and I will continue to explore them further.

###  Summary

Today I worked on a Spring Boot CRUD project. Although some implementation areas and topics need further clarity, the APIs are functional and the project is running successfully. I also led a basic walkthrough of Spring Boot concepts and structure for better understanding.
