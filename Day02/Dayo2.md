# Encapsulation

1. **Overview** – Encapsulation means hiding internal data and exposing access via methods, ensuring clean and secure code design.

2. **Problem** – Without encapsulation, data can be accessed or modified directly, leading to bugs, invalid data, and security risks.

3. **Advantages & Disadvantages** – 
   -  Advantages: Data protection, easier maintenance, modularity.
   -  Disadvantages: Verbosity (getters/setters), potential misuse, reduced flexibility.

4. **Java Use Cases** – Used in Model classes, JavaBeans, and Spring Boot DTOs/Entities to enforce structure and validation.

5. **Specific Problem Example** – Preventing negative age input by validating inside a setter ensures only correct data enters the system.
