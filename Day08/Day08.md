## Today’s Topics

### 1️ ER Model Task
-  Reviewed basic Entity-Relationship modeling.
-  Identified key entities, attributes, and relationships.
-  Focused on modeling real-world entities for project use.

### 2 Understanding JPA/Hibernate Associations
-  Studied different types of relationships:
  - `@OneToOne`
  - `@OneToMany`
  - `@ManyToOne`
  - `@ManyToMany`
-  Understood cascading, fetch types, and mappedBy usage.
-  Created examples for each association in Spring Boot.

### 3 Code-Level Understanding of Relationships and Role Feature
-  Implemented relationships using annotations.
-  Connected relational structure with code (Entities, Repositories, DTOs, Services).
-  Explored how to add **Role-based Access Control** (RBAC):
  - Created `Role` entity and linked with `User`
  - Assigned different roles (e.g., `ADMIN`, `USER`)
  - Set permissions for accessing specific endpoints

 **Summary:**  
Today was productive! I improved my understanding of ER modeling, mastered JPA relationships, and successfully mapped them in Spring Boot code. Also started working on Role-based features for access control.
